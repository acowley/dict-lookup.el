# `dict` interface for Emacs

Adaptation of [osx-dictionary.el](https://github.com/xuchunyang/osx-dictionary.el) to the `dict` dictionary client commonly available on unix systems. Typical usage is to lookup a word at point, at which time a new buffer with the definitions will open. This window can be dismissed by hitting `q`, and you will be back where you were. Or you can search for another word in the `dict-lookup` buffer by hitting `s`.

That's it.
